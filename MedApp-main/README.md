# 🚑 MedApp

🚨 _Created for InnovateNSUT 2021_

✨ This application aims to be a one stop solution for online consulations conducted by medical professionals. It has a great UI, integraded Video Call and an automated diagnosis predictor that suggest most likely conditions based on a patient's ailments.

## 💡 Motivation

In the times of Covid-19, a lot of OPD sessions are carried out online and yet many doctors have to use different services for the video call, taking notes, managing patients etc. This app provides all those services in one single place.

🚀 The application is on Netlify at [Hosted Project](https://med-app-nsut.netlify.app/)

## 🚚 Using the application

-  Visit the [Hosted Project](https://med-app-nsut.netlify.app/). You will be greeted with a login page as such:
